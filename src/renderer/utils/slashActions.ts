// Client-action slash commands
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Most slash commands either insert text into the input (and get sent to the
// AI, e.g. `/compact`) or are disk-backed skills/commands discovered by the
// Rust scanner. A *client-action* command is different: selecting it triggers
// a renderer-side UI action (e.g. opening the goal/cron panel) and is never
// sent to the AI.
//
// Such a command's behavior lives entirely in the renderer, so it is also
// *defined* and *injected* in the renderer (not registered in the Rust builtin
// list). It is only surfaced when the host wires an `onSlashAction` handler to
// service it — so it can never appear as a dead entry whose action can't run.
// This keeps the command and its action coupled by construction.
