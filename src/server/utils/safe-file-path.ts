/**
 * Safe file path guard for capabilities that forward AI-supplied paths to
 * filesystem readers (e.g. IM media sending, PDF ingestion, etc.).
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `im send-media` and friends read a file off disk and ship it to a remote
 * destination (an IM chat). If the `filePath` argument is taken directly from
 * AI output, a prompt-injected AI can be steered into reading arbitrary
 * absolute paths — `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.aws/credentials`, other users' session
 * history — and exfiltrating them. v0.1.67 widened this surface by exposing
 * the same capability through a plain shell CLI that any external runtime's
 * shell tool can invoke, so we harden all call sites at once instead of only
 * the new entry point.
 *
 * What is allowed
 * ---------------
 * An allowlist of roots, each independently resolved and canonicalised:
 *   - current workspace (AI's own workspace directory)
 *   - `~/.hamuna/tmp` (scratch space, where AI writes intermediate files)
 *   - platform temp dir (/tmp on Unix, %TEMP% on Windows)
 *
 * A path is accepted iff, after `fs.realpathSync` resolution (dereferencing
 * symlinks), it sits under one of the allowlist roots. Symlinks pointing
 * outside the allowlist are rejected — that's the whole point of realpath.
 *
 * Callers receive either the canonicalised absolute path (safe to hand off)
 * or an `Error` describing why the path was rejected. Never a silent pass.
